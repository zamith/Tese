There has been a enormous growth in the very large scale distributed databases (VLSD) area in the last few years, especially with the NoSQL movement. These databases intend to be almost schema-less and not as strict as their relational counterparts on what concerns the data model, in order to achieve higher scalability. 

Their query API tends to be very reduced and simple (mainly a put, a get and a delete) and has very fast writes and reads, with the downside of not having a standard querying language as is SQL. Therefore, this properties can be seen as a capability loss in both consistency and query power. 

There is a large code base and number of projects already in production that where coded in SQL and some of them could benefit from using a VLSD as their underlying data store. However, it would be extremely hard to seamlessly migrate from one architecture to the other.  

In this context, the work presented in this Master's thesis is the result of evaluating how to offer an SQL interface for a VLSD that would allow to do such a migration without loosing the transactional guarantees given by a traditional relational system. The proposed solution uses Apache Derby DB, Apache Cassandra and Apache Zookeeper having benefits and drawbacks that were pointed out and analyzed.
