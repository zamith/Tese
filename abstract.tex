There has been a enormous growth in the distributed databases area in the last few years, especially with the NoSQL movement. These databases intend to be almost schema-less and not as strict as their relational counterparts on what concerns the data model, in order to achieve higher scalability. 

Their query API tends to be very reduced and simple (mainly a put, a get and a delete), which grants them very fast writes and reads. All this properties can also be seen as a capability loss in both consistency and query power. There was, therefore, a need to expose the various arguments in favor of and against these properties as well as the attempts that have been and are being made to bring these two technologies closer, and why they are not satisfying enough.

In this context, the work presented in this Master's thesis is the result of evaluating how to take properties from relational and non-relational databases and merge them together. The proposed solution uses Apache Derby DB, Apache Cassandra and Apache Zookeeper having benefits and drawbacks that were pointed out and analyzed.

Finally, to evaluate the proposed and implemented solution we used a workload based on the one defined by the TPC-W benchmark, widely used to benchmark business oriented transactional web servers. Under this specification, we have evaluated our proposal on different scenarios and configurations.
